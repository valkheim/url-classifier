Hacking on our project
======================

Here are some guidelines for hacking on our project.


Adding Features
---------------


Loaded features are set in features/features.py Features code is in features/
with one file per feature. Consider testing your feature. Feature must be as
light as possible.


Coding Style
------------

- Use the pycodestyle, pep8 linter.

- Don't use tabs, editors are messing them up too easily. Increment unit is four
spaces.


Running Tests
-------------

Read the `/run_tests.sh` script.
